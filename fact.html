This wonderfully hallucinogenic animation is about Rick Sanchez, the smartest mammal in the galaxy as well as a sociopathic narcissist, and his grandson Morty, a simple, neurotic teenage boy. With him along for the ride is his granddaughter Summer, a sharp-tongued sharp-witted older teenager, his daughter Beth, an aggressive, highly-intelligent horse-surgeon, and her husband Jerry, a wet paper bag. Here are the 70 most Ricktastic facts about Rick and Morty! <p>1:Justin Roiland himself voices both Rick and Morty.</p> <p>2:Roiland originally wanted the show to run in eleven-minute segments, but Adult Swim pushed for half-hour episodes.</p> <p>3:Rick and Morty has shown its popularity by picking up a raft of awards since it started, including the IGN People’s Choice Award for Best Animated Series in 2015 and 2017, and the IGN Award for Best Animated Series in 2015 and 2017.</p> <p>4:The show’s animation is done using Toon Boom Harmony, with all of the show’s background art being created on Adobe Photoshop. Post production takes place using Adobe After Effects.</p> <p>5:The show’s two titular characters are based on a pair of characters from an animated short by co-creator Justin Roiland called The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti.</p> <p>6:Justin Roiland created a small animated show called House of Cosbys, which led to him getting numerous cease and desist letters from Bill Cosby’s lawyers. As a humorous protest he decided to create a vulgar Back to the Future parody called The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, with his two characters being named Doc Smith and Mharti McDonhalds to avoid a lawsuit. When Roiland was editing the audio for this he fell in love with the voices he’d done for the two characters, deciding to drop his protest and develop the characters more, eventually shaping them into Rick and Morty.</p> <p>7:Rick and Morty’s intro and theme song are a parody mix of Doctor Who and Tintin.</p> <p>8:Rick re-joined the Smith family one month before the events of the show’s pilot episode.</p> <p>9:The universe where we see most of the events take place on Earth is Earth Cesium-137. That’s why Rick and Morty often refer to themselves, or are referred to, as “Rick C-137” and “Morty C-137.”</p> <p>10:The second episode of the show’s first season (Lawnmower Dog) is based on a pilot that Justin Roiland developed for Cartoon Network called DogWorld, where two kids find a portal to a world inhabited by intelligent dogs with human pets.</p> <p>11:Also in this episode Rick refers to Snuffles as “Ruffles,” which is the name of the human pet that the dog family in DogWorld.</p> <p>12:In Lawnmower Dog, the voice of Snowball’s accountant is that of Maurice LaMarche, who voiced The Brain in Pinky and The Brain.</p> <p>13:When recording the dialogue for the show, Roiland improvises a lot on set, which he feels makes the lines more natural. Roiland calls the improvisations “Alts” and will record a whole bunch of improvised one-liners and jokes quipped by Rick or Morty before choosing one to make the episode’s cut.</p> <p>14:As Rick spends most of his time drunk, Roiland once tried method acting and getting drunk before doing the recording of Rick’s dialogue. It didn’t go well, and he barely got any recording done!</p> <p>15:Ever thought that Rick’s daughter Beth sounds familiar? Well that’s because she’s voiced by actress Sarah Chalke, who played Elliot in Scrubs, Stella in How I Met Your Mother and Amy in Backstrom.</p> <p>16:Sarah Chalke is also a huge fan of Rick and Morty’s artwork.</p> <p>17:In fact, Beth is the third time Sarah Chalke has played a blonde doctor. Although if you ask Jerry, he’d say she’s only played a blonde doctor twice as being a horse surgeon apparently isn’t the same as being a “real doctor.”</p> <p>18:Each one of Rick’s characteristic burps is a real burp.</p> <p>19:Rick’s burping only came to be because, when voicing Doc in The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, Roiland accidentally burped in the middle of a line. He said it was so gross and funny he thought “let’s see if I can do that again for a couple more lines.”</p> <p>20:Although he does all the burps, Roiland has said before it’s not easy for him. He sits in the studio with a can of low-calorie beer and a bottle of water, waiting for them to come naturally as he can’t force them or burp on command. He tells the engineers recording the show “Just leave it rolling, because I don’t know when this burp is coming!” </p> <p>21:Justin Roiland has also said that Sarah Chalke can burp on command and that he’s very jealous of her.</p> <p>22:When traveling in cars Rick never wears a seatbelt, while all the other characters do.</p> <p>23:Every time we see a vehicle door open with Rick inside, empty beer cans and bottles either come pouring out or can be heard rattling around.</p> <p>24:Spencer Grammar who voices Summer, said that if she could travel back in time she’d kill Hitler. Whilst this would do the world as a whole some good, it’d be shame for Rick and Morty fans as it would never give us the joyous combination of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln rolled into one character in Abradolf Lincler, a “misguided venture” of Rick’s to create a morally neutral super leader by combining the DNA of the two. Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes!</p> <p>25:In the episode Get Schwifty in Season 2, we find out that Rick, Bird Person and Squanchy were in a rock band together called “The Flesh Curtains.”</p> <p>26:Rick and Morty has had a raft of celebrity guest stars doing voices on the show over the duration of its run to-date. Just a few notable names include Stephen Colbert, Dana Carvey, Claudia Black, Nathan Fillion, Susan Sarandon, Joel McHale, Rich Fulcher, Christian Slater and Danny Trejo.</p> <p>27:In the episode Night Shaym-Aliens! in Season 1, we are introduced to the Zigerions, alien scammers after Rick’s formula for concentrated dark matter. Their leader, Prince Nebulon (Yes, a scamming Zigerion Prince), was voiced by David Cross who played Tobias Fünke in Arrested Development. Both the Zigerions and Tobias Fünke are massively uncomfortable with nudity.</p> <p>28:In the episode Auto Erotic Assimilation in Season 2, we are introduced to Unity, a hive-mind entity which Rick used to date. Rick gets Unity to create a TV show for him, which is actually a copy of Dan Harmon’s show Community, and features all the main characters in the show: Jeff, Annie, Shirley, Pierce, Troy, Abed, and Britta. It even references Community being cancelled and bought back when Rick tells Unity “Now cancel it! Okay now put it back on.”</p> <p>29:At the end of this episode, we see Rick attempt suicide before choosing not to. Just before he does this he drinks an orange liquid from an Erlenmeyer flask. This orange liquid synchronizes all of the possible Ricks in every conceivable reality, meaning had Rick not bowed his head down and actually killed himself, that every single Rick across the entire multiverse would have ceased to exist.</p> <p>30:The way in which Rick says the word “bitch” is style after how Jesse Pinkman said the word in Breaking Bad. </p> <p>31:Rick’s swearing isn’t the only thing the Rick and Morty team were inspired by from Breaking Bad. The inspiration for the premise of Pickle Rick came from Breaking Bad’s episode 4 Days Out in Season 2, where Jesse and Walt are stranded in the desert and Walt shows some true ingenuity to work with nothing and save them both. This led to Dan Harmon wanting to test Rick’s genius, saying “How smart is Rick, though? Is he so smart that with his mouth alone he could gain an advantage over biological killing machines in an environment that wasn’t built to sustain him?”</p> <p>32:In the early stages of production, Breaking Bad’s Bryan Cranston auditioned for the role of Jerry.</p> <p>33:The word “Rick” is often used in episode titles in lieu of other words, such as Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind, A Rickle In Time, Total Rickall, and The Rickshank Rickdemption, to name a few.</p> <p>34:In fact, Rick’s name appears 16 times in episode names out of 31 total episodes.</p> </div> <button class="current first-fact">1</button> <button class="second-fact">2</button> </div> </main> <footer> </footer> <script src="/rickandmorty/fact.489bf4b5.js" type="module"></script><script src="/rickandmorty/fact.d48333ef.js" nomodule="" defer></script>  </body></html>
